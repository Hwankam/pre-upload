### 2. Purpose

* Our goal is to **review and implement** the results of "A randomized exchange algorithm for Computing Optimal Approximate Designs of Experiments" by Harman, Radoslav, Lenka Filová, and Peter Richtárik (2018), which suggests a novel "Randomized Exchange Algorithm" for computing Optimal Designs of Experiments.
* Implement algorithms in the paper by Julia and compare to a preceding research.



### 3. What to do in the project
- In this project, we investigate and implement the method of Computing Optimal Approximate Designs of Experiments.

##### (1) Theory studying
- Understand the various previous algorithms suggested in the paper to compute Optimal Approximate Designs of Experiments.  There are Vertex Direction Method, Vertex Exchange Method, Subspace ascent method, Randomized Exchange algorithm.
- Understand the connection between existing literatures in subspace descent method and REX.
- Understand the proof of Convergence of REX algorithm for D-optimality.

##### (2)  Reproduce the algorithms and examples suggested in the paper.
- Implement the various algorithms suggested in the paper: Cocktail Algorithms, YBT, REX and so on.
- **Reproduce** the 2 numerical examples suggested in the paper : Quadratic models and Random models to compare the results of Cocktail Algorithms, YBT, REX. It corresponds to **Figure 1** in the "A randomized exchange algorithm for Computing Optimal Approximate Designs of Experiments" by Harman, Radoslav, Lenka Filová, and Peter Richtárik (2018).
